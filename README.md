## 🚀 Executive Summary
**The Problem:** Identifying "Revenue Leakage" in a B2B service platform (Honda Dealership) where 35% of the user base lacked valid contact data, preventing re-engagement.
**The Solution:** I built a SQL-based simulation to treat operational logs as SaaS activity data, modeling Churn Risk and Infrastructure Efficiency.
**The Impact:** Modeled a **$79,830 USD** annual revenue recovery opportunity (Realistic Scenario) by implementing a "Win-Back" strategy for high-LTV accounts.

## 🔄 The "Translator" Layer (Why this matters for SaaS)
This project analyzes real-world operational data through the lens of **B2B SaaS Metrics**. I translated physical service events into digital subscription concepts to demonstrate business acumen.

| Operational Concept (Raw Data) | SaaS Equivalent (The Insight) | Business Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Missing Phone Number** | **Incomplete User Profile** | Prevents re-engagement & increases Churn Risk. |
| **Service Appointment** | **Active User Session** | Measuring DAU/MAU (Daily/Monthly Active Users). |
| **Advisor Name** | **Customer Success Manager (CSM)** | Evaluating Account Manager performance. |
| **Morning vs. Afternoon Shift** | **Server Load / Cloud Capacity** | Optimizing AWS/Azure fixed costs during idle times. |
| **Car Models (CR-V, HR-V)** | **Subscription Tiers (Pro, Enterprise)** | Identifying High-LTV segments for upsell. |

## 📂 Repository Structure & Analysis Pipeline

This project follows a strict ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) logic, separating data cleaning from financial analysis.

| File | Type | Business Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `00_schema_prep.sql` | **ETL / Prep** | Normalizes Spanish raw columns to English business standards (`asesor` → `advisor_name`). |
| `01_data_quality_audit.sql` | **Quality** | Validates integrity (filtering impossible dates & negative billable hours) to ensure accurate reporting. |
| `02_revenue_leakage.sql` | **Revenue** | Quantifies the "Cost of Bad Data". Calculates total money left on the table due to "Ghost Users". |
| `03_operational_capacity.sql`| **Ops / Cost** | Analyzes "Dead Cloud Spend" (Dead Rent). Identifies 40% idle capacity in afternoon shifts. |
| `04_product_mix.sql` | **Strategy** | Uses **Pareto Analysis** (`RANK()`) to identify the top 2 "Star Tiers" driving 80% of volume. |
| `05_retention_strategy.sql` | **Action** | Generates a specific SQL list of High-Value customers at risk of churning (>180 days inactive). |
| `06_scenario_modeling.sql` | **Financial** | Projects recovery outcomes: **Pessimistic (5%)**, **Realistic (15%)**, and **Optimistic (30%)**. |
| `07_saas_metrics.sql` | **Simulation** | **North Star Metrics**: Calculates Inactivity Rates (Churn Proxy) and Revenue Exposure per Tier. |

## 💰 Key Findings & Financial Scenarios

Instead of assuming a "total loss," I modeled three recovery scenarios based on a standard ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of **$120 USD**.

### 📉 Scenario Analysis (Recovery Potential)
| Scenario | Recovery Rate | Estimated Revenue Impact | Strategy Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pessimistic** | 5% | **$26,310** | Passive Email Automation |
| **Realistic** | **15%** | **$78,930** | SMS + Dedicated CSM Outreach |
| **Optimistic** | 30% | **$157,860** | Full Account Management Intervention |

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Skills Demonstrated
* **Advanced SQL**: Window Functions (`RANK()`, `OVER`), CTEs (`WITH`), Conditional Aggregation (`FILTER`), and `CASE WHEN` logic.
* **Data Cleaning**: Handling NULLs, string normalization, and regex-like filtering.
* **Business Intelligence**: translating raw logs into actionable KPIs (Churn Rate, Utilization %, ARPU).
* **Financial Modeling**: Creating hypothetical revenue scenarios based on data evidence.
